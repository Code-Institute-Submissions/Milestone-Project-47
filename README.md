VisitMorocco

My project is based on providing a website for users about visiting Morocco, as it is becoming more popular with holidaymakers and tourists. 
The website will give the user information about the best cities in Morocco to visit such as Casablanca, Marrakech, Agadir and Fes. 
It will allow the user to search what these cities have to offer will start the user on booking a holiday to morocco.

UX

User Stories

Below are user stories that were made so that I have a vision for my website:

I want to able to browse the website on my phone, tablet or laptop.

I want the website to be easy to use and be as clear as possible

I want to know more about what cities in Morocco have to offer. 

I want to see a map showing what hotels I can stay at, restaurants I can eat at and places I can visit. 

I want to see images of what the cities in Morocco look like.

I would like to register my interest in visiting Morocco.

Strategy
My plan for the website was to create something for the user that they would learn more about what Morocco has to offer and to see what they can do in cities like Marrakech,
so they would be more interested in visiting then they were before they visited the website.

Scope
The website is to show interested holidaymakers and tourists the different types of places they can visit in Morocco from the Iconic city of Casablanca to the sandy beaches of Agadir.
I also wanted to provide the user with the ability to research the holiday so see what hotels they would like to stay at and places to eat and where they would like to visit.
Another aspect of the website is to allow customer to register register so we can contact them to book their visit.

Structure
I have laid out my website so that on the home section there is a beautiful image of an moroccan city which will cover most of the home section, this will convince the user to learn more about the website and below the image there will be a small paragraph that will inform the user of the purpose of the site.
Below this, we have the 'Where To Visit' section, there will be a carousel that will show images of the most popular cities in Morocco and will have a paragraph on each image to give the user more information the city.
The next section is the 'Travel Planning' section, where I have placed a search box at the top of this section so the user can search the city they are interested in and next to the search box will be buttons for the user to click on depending on what they would like their search to focus on such as hotels, restaurants and attractions and below this will be the map so when the user has chosen the city of their choice they can then browse through the different hotels, restaurants and attractions.
'Book Your Visit' is the last section on the website, there will be a form for the user to fill out and once submitted a modal will appear to confirm that. 

Skeleton
Below are links to the wireframes for this project and are designed to include different versions for a desktop, tablet and mobile phone view.

Surface
I have used a combination of a vibrant orange and white for the header and footer as this give the website a old school but stil refreshing look.
The background color for the sections is white, this is because I believed it was best to keep it simple so the user can focus on the features of each section.
