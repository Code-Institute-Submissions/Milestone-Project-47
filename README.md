# VisitMorocco

#### My project is based on providing a site for users about visiting Morocco, as it is becoming more popular with holidaymakers and tourists. The site will give the user information about the best cities in Morocco to visit such as Casablanca, Marrakech, Agadir and Fes. It will allow the user to search what these cities have to offer and will start the user on booking a holiday to Morocco.

### UX

#### User Stories

Below are user stories that were made so that I have a vision for my project:

I want the site to be easy to use and be as clear as possible

I want to know more about what cities in Morocco have to offer. 

I want to see a map showing what hotels I can stay at, restaurants I can eat at and places I can visit. 

I want to see images of what the cities in Morocco look like.

I would like to register my interest in visiting Morocco.

#### Strategy
My plan for the site was to create somewhere where they would learn more about what Morocco has to offer and to see what they can do in cities like Marrakech. 
It was to offer a good user experience so they would be more interested in visiting then they were before they visited the website.

#### Scope
The site is to provide interested holidaymakers and tourists with the different types of places they can visit in Morocco from the iconic city of Casablanca to the sandy beaches of Agadir.
I also wanted to provide the user with the ability to research their holiday so they can see what hotels they would like to stay at and places to eat and where they would like to visit.
Another aspect of the site is to allow users to register so we can contact them to book their visit.

#### Structure
I have laid out my site so that on the home section there is a beautiful image of an Moroccan city which will cover most of the home section, this will convince the user to learn more about the site and below the image there will be a small paragraph that will inform the user of the purpose of the site.
Below this, we have the 'Where To Visit' section, here will be a carousel that will show images of the most popular cities in Morocco and will have a paragraph on each image to give the user more information the city.
The next section is the 'Travel Planning' section, where I have placed a search box at the top of this section so the user can search the city they are interested in and next to the search box will be buttons for the user to click on depending on what they would like their search to focus on such as hotels, restaurants and attractions and below this will be the map so when the user has chosen the city of their choice they can then browse through the different hotels, restaurants and attractions.
'Book Your Visit' is the last section on the page, there will be a form for the user to fill out and a message below that we'll be in touch. 

#### Skeleton
Below are links to the wireframes for this project and are designed to include different versions for a desktop, tablet and mobile phone view.

[Wireframes](https://github.com/WHusssain937/Milestone-Project-2/tree/master/wireframes)

#### Surface
I have used a combination of a vibrant orange and white for the header and footer as this give the site a old school feel but still a refreshing look.
The background color for the sections is white, this is because I believed it was best to keep it simple so the user can focus on the features of each section.
The font that is used is 'Kalam' as I think it gives the site a foreign look and used a light black or white as the font color.

##### [EmaiLJS](https://www.emailjs.com/)
This was used to link the form to a email address so when a form is submitted, it is sent to the email address linked to the site.

### Testing 

##### [HTML Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)
This was used to text the HTML file and errors did come up like a missing div tag at the end of the section for 'Book You Visit', there were other errors in this section such as more missing div tags that caused me to add css to style the booking form to correct this.
The 'Back To Top' button was another error as an anchor tag couldn't go inside the button tag, so to fix this I have gotten rid of the button tag and this has corrected the error.
I have also gotten rid of all the 'Back To Top' buttons and left one at the bottom of the body after the footer so that it can work, this was as the ID couldnt be used more then once and this was the error that they couldnt be multiple anchors with the same ID.

##### [CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) 
This website was used to check the css file and there was no errors.

#### Testing For User Stories Objectives

##### Easy to use 
The site is simple for the user as it is one page, the user have been told what to do by scrolling down to learn more and there are links in the navbar that will take the user to the section they require. 
If the user wishes to return to a different section then they can simply click on the 'Back To Top' button and it will take them to the home page where they can click on the section they require in the navbar.

##### I want to know more about what cities in Morocco have to offer.
This user story will be achieved by going to the 'Where to Visit' section as the carousel will have brief information of each city and what they famous for.  

##### Images of Cities of Morocco
If the user goes to the 'Where To Visit' section, they will be able to view the different cities of Morroco and they can just wait for the images to change in the carousel or use the arrows on the left or right side to change images.

##### Map and Its Functions
- Go to 'Travel Planning' section by clicking the link in the navbar or scrolling down.
- First I will choose the city in the search box, if Marrakesh or Fes are typed in then that option will appear as expected, but if any city outside Morocco is put in then the option would not appear so if London is typed in then that option will not come up as expected.
- When the city has been clicked on in the search box like, for example Agadir the map will automatically zoom into Agadir.
- Then when the map zooms in, it will automatically bring up green markers on hotel locations in Agadir as expected.
- Then if the restaurant button is clicked, it will bring up green markers on restaurant locations instead in Agadir as expected. 
- Then if the attractions button is clicked, it will bring up green markers on attractions instead in Agadir as expected. 
- If then one of the green markers is clicked on, it will bring up a small window with information on the hotel or restaurant or attraction in Agadir as expected.
- If I think that the map is too small, I can click on the full screen icon in the map and it will enlarge the map and will show the full screen of Agadir as expected.
- If I then want to see a street view of Agadir, then I can drag the pegman on where I want to see street view and it will bring it up as expected. 
- If I wanted to zoom more into the map of Agadir, then when the plus icon in the bottom right of the map is clicked it will zoom into Agadir.
- If I wanted to zoom out of Agadir to see where it is located in the country, then I would click on the minus icon in the map in the bottom right and it will zoom out of Agadir as expected. 

##### Booking Form
- Go to 'Book Your Visit' section by clicking the link in the navbar.
- First I filled in my full name on the form and submitted the form, but as expected it would not allow the form to be submitted as the other required boxes had not been filled out. 
- Then I filled in both the name and email boxes of the form and submitted it, but as expected it would not as not all required parts of form were filled in and an valid email address was not inputted. 
- Then I filled in the name, email and contact boxes and the form did submit as expected as these were all the required boxes that were filled out.
- I then filled out the boxes including the additional information box and then clicked on the checkbox and as expected I am able to click all three of the options or none of them.
- Lastly when the form is submitted, an email is sent to the site's email address with the information from the form.
- This is the email that will be recieved once the form is submitted [VisitMorocco Email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&view=btop&ver=1nj101dboqm98&search=inbox&th=%23thread-f%3A1664984786943019499&cvid=2).

#### Websites & Devices Testing
This ite was tested on different devices such as a large desktop screen, laptop, Samsung S10+, Iphone 6/7/8, Ipad Pro and Ipad and on multiple web browsers such as Google Chrome, Internet Exployer and Firefox to make sure that it was responsive and compatible.
I also had my friends and family tests it on their phones and laptops and it was responsive. 
An issue that appeared in testing was that the 'Back to Top' button was interfering with other icons and buttons on mobile phone screens and was taking too much room on the screen so I have hidden it on mobile phone screens so it won't intefer with the sections.
Another issue was the captions in the carousel as on smaller screens like tablets and mobile phones this information was taking too much room and covering the images so the user would not be able to see them, to fix this I have had the information not appear on screen sizes tablets or small so the user will have a clear view of the image and only the name of the city in the captions.

When the site was published on Github Pages it wouldn't allow the maps and functions to work, this was becuase http address was not added to the API key to allow it to render the map, after it was added to the API key the map worked.
Another issue was the carousel images were not appearing, this was becuase the img source had a slash at the begin which stopped github pages from deploying them, after this was removed the images now appear.

### Deployment
This site was made using Gitpod, it was used for version control and commits and then pushed to a repository in Github. 

##### Run Code Locally
To run locally, you can clone this respository directly in the terminal of the environment you are using for code editing type: git clone [VisitMorocco](https://github.com/WHusssain937/Milestone-Project-2).
To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type git remote rm origin into the terminal.

##### Creating Your Own API keys
To use this code, you will need to optain your own API key, this can easily be done by following this link [Google Maps Api](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key).
After you have your Api key, just go into the index.html file and optain the Google Maps Api script tag and replace the Api key with your one.

##### Connecting To EmaiLJS
If you would like to use this code, then you will need to make your own EmaiLJS account and follow these instructions to set up [EmailJS Tutorial](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/tutorial/overview/).
You will also need to make sure to allow your google account to accept emails from less secure apps such as Gitpod, as this was an issue I had. Follow this link to allow[Less Secure Apps Help](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en).
